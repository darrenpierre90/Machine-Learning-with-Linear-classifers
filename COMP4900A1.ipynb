        "## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:\n",
        "\n",
        "The file \"sonar.mines\" contains 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar\n",
        "signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various\n",
        "conditions.  The file \"sonar.rocks\" contains 97 patterns obtained from\n",
        "rocks under similar conditions.  The transmitted sonar signal is a\n",
        "frequency-modulated chirp, rising in frequency.  The data set contains\n",
        "signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning 90\n",
        "degrees for the cylinder and 180 degrees for the rock.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  Each number\n",
        "represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over\n",
        "a certain period of time.  The integration aperture for higher frequencies\n",

        "The label associated with each record contains the letter \"R\" if the object\n",
